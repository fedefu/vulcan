#Vulcan Coin

The environmental, social and energy crises are some of this decadeâ€™s major challenges.

The oil and gas that we consume finances war. Faster decarbonization is not only an issue of environment, but also of national security and ethics. At the same time, families struggle to pay energy bills, as costs are propelled by war, growing geopolitical instability and rising inflation.

We believe that these challenges can be faced through decentralization and community engagement. We also believe that fighting climate change, economic development and national security are compatible objectives.

We are set to incentivize real-world environmental activity and revolutionize how people finance their energy saving investments at home with a cryptocurrency.
